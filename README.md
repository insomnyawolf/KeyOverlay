IF YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH FULLSCREEN, TRY USING GAME CAPTURE INSTEAD OF WINDOW CAPTURE IN OBS!


## config.json properties

Will be autogenerated the first time that you open this program, there you will be able to find some samples of everything that you can customize but for the important things =>

keyAmount - Calculated via defined and enabled keys

keys => Keys the program should use

they can be:
* Keyboard (for numbers and symbols [please refer to this table](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.5.1/classsf_1_1Keyboard.php#acb4cacd7cc5802dec45724cf3314a142)),
* Mouse [mouse button options](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.5.1/classsf_1_1Mouse.php#a4fb128be433f9aafe66bc0c605daaa90).

There should be several examples

Hopefully it will be easily understood by everyone but if you have troubles with anything, feel free to ask.

## New Features

* Per-Key Color
* Width automatically calculated
* Per-Key HitCount saving

## Known Issues

* White-Screen sometimes (?)
  * Cause traced (more or less), it's related to the fading part so it'll be disabled till a fix is found (help aprecciated)
  * Maybe it's caused due to texture corruption, try checking the texture before drawing
* You Tell Me

## Planned features

* Hot reload (not yet)
* Key Profiles (for diferent games/gamemodes as example)

## Insomnya's note

This is basically a BIG rewrite focused on trying to add features from several different branches and optimize what we had already (bruh linq is cool but wa completly stupid to use it here, changing ``foreach`` into ``for`` is faster and also give you the index that they were using on linq to find things, i know it ain't much but each bit counts).

↑ I've already suffered this problem in the past, one learn something new and tries to use it everywhere... it happens sometimes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ↑

I'm also trying to achive "hot-reloading" so you can change the config of the program and it updates the ui without needen to close and reopen it.

I'd like to sare this as ``MIT`` or ``ISC`` or ``Beerware`` bit it's sadly ``GNU GPL`` so i basically can't (Maybe in a future if i do a complete rewrite from scratch.)...

However, the ConfigHelper is completly made by me and you can use it as ``MIT`` or ``ISC`` or ``Beerware``, the one you prefer.

Have a great day!!
